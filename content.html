    <h1>The Lions</h1>
    <p>Present in Africa and India, the lion typically inhabits grasslands and
        savannahs, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal
        than other big cats, but when persecuted adapts to being active at
        night and at twilight. A lion pride consists of a few adult males,
        related females and cubs. Prides vary in size and composition from
        three to 20 adult lions, depending on habitat and prey
        availability. Females cooperate when hunting and prey mostly on
        large ungulates, including antelope, deer, buffalo, zebra and
        even giraffe
